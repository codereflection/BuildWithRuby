# Welcome to the albacore project.

albacore is a suite of Rake tasks to automate the process of building a .NET based system. It's like MSBuild or Nant... but without all the stabby-bracket xmlhell.

## How To Use albacore

Check out the [albacore Wiki](http://wiki.github.com/derickbailey/albacore) for detailed instructions on how to use the built in tasks and their options. 

If you are new to Ruby and Rake, head over to the [getting started](https://github.com/derickbailey/Albacore/wiki/Getting-Started) wiki page.
