- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Create the config file object. <tt>args</tt> is the list of arguments from the command line.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The following command line options are handled early here rather than later at the time most command options are processed.
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "<tt>--config-file</tt>, <tt>--config-file==NAME</tt>:"
    body: Obviously these need to be handled by the ConfigFile object to ensure we get the right config file.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "<tt>--backtrace</tt>:"
    body: Backtrace needs to be turned on early so that errors before normal option parsing can be properly handled.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "<tt>--debug</tt>:"
    body: Enable Ruby level debug messages. Handled early for the same reason as --backtrace.
