      <p>
The Version class processes string versions into comparable values. A
version string should normally be a series of numbers separated by periods.
Each part (digits separated by periods) is considered its own number, and
these are used for sorting. So for instance, 3.10 sorts higher than 3.2
because ten is greater than two.
</p>
<p>
If any part contains letters (currently only a-z are supported) then that
version is considered prerelease. Versions with a prerelease part in the
Nth part sort less than versions with N-1 parts. Prerelease parts are
sorted alphabetically using the normal Ruby string sorting rules. If a
prerelease part contains both letters and numbers, it will be broken into
multiple parts to provide expected sort behavior (1.0.a10 becomes 1.0.a.10,
and is greater than 1.0.a9).
</p>
<p>
Prereleases sort between real releases (newest to oldest):
</p>
<ol>
<li>1.0

</li>
<li>1.0.b1

</li>
<li>1.0.a.2

</li>
<li>0.9

</li>
</ol>
<h2>How Software Changes</h2>
<p>
Users expect to be able to specify a version constraint that gives them
some reasonable expectation that new versions of a library will work with
their software if the version constraint is true, and not work with their
software if the version constraint is false. In other words, the perfect
system will accept all compatible versions of the library and reject all
incompatible versions.
</p>
<p>
Libraries change in 3 ways (well, more than 3, but stay focused here!).
</p>
<ol>
<li>The change may be an implementation detail only and have no effect on the
client software.

</li>
<li>The change may add new features, but do so in a way that client software
written to an earlier version is still compatible.

</li>
<li>The change may change the public interface of the library in such a way
that old software is no longer compatible.

</li>
</ol>
<p>
Some examples are appropriate at this point. Suppose I have a Stack class
that supports a <tt>push</tt> and a <tt>pop</tt> method.
</p>
<h3>Examples of Category 1 changes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Switch from an array based implementation to a linked-list based
implementation.

</li>
<li>Provide an automatic (and transparent) backing store for large stacks.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples of Category 2 changes might be:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add a <tt>depth</tt> method to return the current depth of the stack.

</li>
<li>Add a <tt>top</tt> method that returns the current top of stack (without
changing the stack).

</li>
<li>Change <tt>push</tt> so that it returns the item pushed (previously it had
no usable return value).

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples of Category 3 changes might be:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Changes <tt>pop</tt> so that it no longer returns a value (you must use
<tt>top</tt> to get the top of the stack).

</li>
<li>Rename the methods to <tt>push_item</tt> and <tt>pop_item</tt>.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>RubyGems Rational Versioning</h2>
<ul>
<li>Versions shall be represented by three non-negative integers, separated by
periods (e.g. 3.1.4). The first integers is the &quot;major&quot; version
number, the second integer is the &quot;minor&quot; version number, and the
third integer is the &quot;build&quot; number.

</li>
<li>A category 1 change (implementation detail) will increment the build
number.

</li>
<li>A category 2 change (backwards compatible) will increment the minor version
number and reset the build number.

</li>
<li>A category 3 change (incompatible) will increment the major build number
and reset the minor and build numbers.

</li>
<li>Any &quot;public&quot; release of a gem should have a different version.
Normally that means incrementing the build number. This means a developer
can generate builds all day long for himself, but as soon as he/she makes a
public release, the version must be updated.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>
Let&#8216;s work through a project lifecycle using our Stack example from
above.
</p>
<table>
<tr><td valign="top">Version 0.0.1:</td><td>The initial Stack class is release.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Version 0.0.2:</td><td>Switched to a linked=list implementation because it is cooler.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Version 0.1.0:</td><td>Added a <tt>depth</tt> method.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Version 1.0.0:</td><td>Added <tt>top</tt> and made <tt>pop</tt> return nil (<tt>pop</tt> used to
return the old top item).

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Version 1.1.0:</td><td><tt>push</tt> now returns the value pushed (it used it return nil).

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Version 1.1.1:</td><td>Fixed a bug in the linked list implementation.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Version 1.1.2:</td><td>Fixed a bug introduced in the last fix.

</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Client A needs a stack with basic push/pop capability. He writes to the
original interface (no <tt>top</tt>), so his version constraint looks like:
</p>
<pre>
  gem 'stack', '~&gt; 0.0'
</pre>
<p>
Essentially, any version is OK with Client A. An incompatible change to the
library will cause him grief, but he is willing to take the chance (we call
Client A optimistic).
</p>
<p>
Client B is just like Client A except for two things: (1) He uses the
<tt>depth</tt> method and (2) he is worried about future incompatibilities,
so he writes his version constraint like this:
</p>
<pre>
  gem 'stack', '~&gt; 0.1'
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>depth</tt> method was introduced in version 0.1.0, so that version
or anything later is fine, as long as the version stays below version 1.0
where incompatibilities are introduced. We call Client B pessimistic
because he is worried about incompatible future changes (it is OK to be
pessimistic!).

Let&#8216;s say you&#8216;re depending on the fnord gem version 2.y.z. If
you specify your dependency as &quot;&gt;= 2.0.0&quot; then, you&#8216;re
good, right? What happens if fnord 3.0 comes out and it isn&#8216;t
backwards compatible with 2.y.z? Your stuff will break as a result of using
&quot;&gt;=&quot;. The better route is to specify your dependency with a
&quot;spermy&quot; version specifier. They&#8216;re a tad confusing, so
here is how the dependency specifiers work:
</p>
<pre>
  Specification From  ... To (exclusive)
  &quot;&gt;= 3.0&quot;      3.0   ... &amp;infin;
  &quot;~&gt; 3.0&quot;      3.0   ... 4.0
  &quot;~&gt; 3.0.0&quot;    3.0.0 ... 3.1
  &quot;~&gt; 3.5&quot;      3.5   ... 4.0
  &quot;~&gt; 3.5.0&quot;    3.5.0 ... 3.6
