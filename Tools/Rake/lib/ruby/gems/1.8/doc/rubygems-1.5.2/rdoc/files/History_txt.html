ï»¿=== 1.5.2 / 2011-02-10
</p>
<p>
NOTE: RubyGems 1.5.0 and 1.5.1 have a broken <tt>gem update
&#8212;system</tt>.
</p>
<p>
To upgrade you&#8216;ll need to use the manual upgrade recipe. Using
sudo/su as appropriate:

  $ update_rubygems
</pre>
<p>

questions. Patch by Erik Hollensbe.

</li>
</ul>
<p>

</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.4.1 / 2010-12-31</h3>
<p>
Since apparently nobody reads my emails, blog posts or the README:
</p>
<p>
DO NOT UPDATE RUBYGEMS ON RUBY 1.9! See UPGRADING.rdoc for details.
</p>
<p>
Bug fix:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Specification#load was untainting a frozen string (via `gem build *.spec`)

</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.4.0 / 2010-12-30</h3>
<p>
NOTE: In order to better maintain rubygems and to get it in sync with the
world (eg, 1.9&#8216;s 1.3.7 is different from our 1.3.7), rubygems is
switching to a 4-6 week release schedule. This release is the precursor to
that process and as such may be a bit on the wild side! You have been
warned!
</p>
<p>
NOTE: We&#8216;ve switched to git/github. See README.rdoc for details.
</p>
<p>
New features:
</p>
<ul>

</li>
<li>Speed up <a href="../classes/Gem/Version.html">Gem::Version</a>#&lt;=&gt;
by 2-3x in common cases. (raggi)

</li>
<li>&#8212;source is now additive with your current sources. Use
&#8212;clear-sources first to maintain previous behavior.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Bug fixes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependency &quot;~&gt;&quot;s now respect lower-bound prerelease versions.

</li>

</li>
<li>Expand Windows user home candidates for Ruby 1.8. Bug 28371 &amp; 28494

</li>
<li>Fix find_files to order by version.

</li>
<li>Fix ivar typo. [Josh Peek]

</li>
<li>Normalized requires and made many of them lazy. Do not depend on rubygems
to require stdlib stuff for you. (raggi/tmm1)

</li>
<li>Treat 1.0.a10 like 1.0.a.10 for sorting, etc. Fixes 27903. (dchelimsky)

</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.3.7 / 2010-05-13</h3>
<p>
NOTE:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://rubygems.org">rubygems.org</a> is now the default source
for downloading gems.
</p>
<p>
You may have sources set via ~/.gemrc, so you should replace <a
href="http://gems.rubyforge.org">gems.rubyforge.org</a> with <a
href="http://rubygems.org">rubygems.org</a>
</p>

<h3>1.2.0 / 2008-06-21</h3>
<p>
New features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>RubyGems no longer performs bulk updates and instead only fetches the
gemspec files it needs. Alternate sources will need to upgrade to RubyGems
1.2 to allow RubyGems to take advantage of the new metadata updater. If a
pre 1.2 remote source is in the sources list, RubyGems will revert to the
bulk update code for compatibility.

</li>
<li>RubyGems now has runtime and development dependency types. Use
add_development_dependency and add_runtime_dependency. All typeless
dependencies are considered to be runtime dependencies.

</li>
<li>RubyGems will now require rubygems/defaults/operating_system.rb and
rubygems/defaults/#{RBX_ENGINE}.rb if they exist. This allows packagers and
ruby implementers to add custom behavior to RubyGems via these files. (If
the RubyGems API is insufficient, please suggest improvements via the
RubyGems list.)

</li>
<li>/etc/gemrc (and windows equivalent) for global settings

</li>
<li>setup.rb now handles &#8212;vendor and &#8212;destdir for packagers

</li>
<li>`gem stale` command that lists gems by last access time

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Bugs Fixed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>File modes from gems are now honored, patch 19737

</li>
<li>Marshal <a href="../classes/Gem/Specification.html">Gem::Specification</a>
objects from the future can now be loaded.

</li>
<li>A trailing / is now added to remote sources when missing, bug 20134

</li>
<li>Gems with legacy platforms will now be correctly uninstalled, patch 19877

</li>
<li>`gem install &#8212;no-wrappers` followed by `gem install &#8212;wrappers`
no longer overwrites executables

</li>
<li>`gem pristine` now forces reinstallation of gems, bug 20387

</li>
<li>RubyGems gracefully handles ^C while loading .gemspec files from disk, bug
20523

</li>
<li>Paths are expanded in more places, bug 19317, bug 19896

</li>
<li><a
href="../classes/Gem/DependencyInstaller.html">Gem::DependencyInstaller</a>
resets installed gems every install, bug 19444

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Gem.html#M000064">Gem.default_path</a> is now honored
if GEM_PATH is not set, patch 19502

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other Changes Include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>setup.rb

<ul>
<li>stub files created by RubyGems 0.7.x and older are no longer removed. When
upgrading from these ancient versions, upgrade to 1.1.x first to clean up
stubs.

</li>
<li>RDoc is no longer required until necessary, patch 20414

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>`gem server`

<ul>
<li>Now completely matches the output of `gem generate_index` and has correct
content types

</li>
<li>Refreshes from source directories for every hit. The server will no longer
need to be restarted after installing gems.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>`gem query &#8212;details` and friends now display author, homepage,
rubyforge url and installed location

</li>
<li>`gem install` without -i no longer reinstalls dependencies if they are in
GEM_PATH but not in GEM_HOME

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Gem/RemoteFetcher.html">Gem::RemoteFetcher</a> now
performs persistent connections for HEAD requests, bug 7973

</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.1.1 / 2008-04-11</h3>
<p>
Bugs Fixed:
</p>
<ul>

Errno::ECONNABORTED.

</li>
<li>Printing of release notes fixed.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.1.0 / 2008-03-29</h3>
<p>
New features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>RubyGems now uses persistent connections on index updates. Index updates
are much faster now.

</li>
<li>RubyGems only updates from a latest index by default, cutting candidate
gems for updates to roughly 1/4 (at present). Index updates are even faster
still.

see all gems.

</li>
</ul>

<h3>0.9.4 / 2007-05-23</h3>
<p>
If you are experiencing problems with the source index (e.g. strange
&quot;No Method&quot; errors), or problems with zlib (e.g. &quot;Buffer
Error&quot; messsage), we recommend upgrading to RubyGems 0.9.4.
</p>
<p>
Bug Fixes Include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Several people have been experiencing problems with no method errors on the
source index cache. The source index cache is now a bit more self healing.
Furthermore, if the source index cache is irreparable, then it is
automatically dropped and reloaded.

</li>
<li>The source cache files may now be dropped with the &quot;gem sources
&#8212;clear-all&quot; command. (This command may require root is the
system source cache is in a root protected area).

</li>
<li>Several sub-commands were accidently dropped from the &quot;gem&quot;
command. These commands have been restored.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.9.3 / 2007-05-10</h3>
<p>
Bug Fixes Include:
</p>
<p>
The ZLib library on Windows will occasionally complains about a buffer
error when unpacking gems. The Gems software has a workaround for that
problem, but the workaround was only enabled for versions of ZLib 1.2.1 or
earlier. We have received several reports of the error occuring with ZLib
1.2.3, so we have permanently enabled the work around on all versions.
</p>
<h3>0.9.2 / 2007-02-05</h3>
<p>
Bug Fixes Include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The &quot;unpack&quot; command now works properly.

</li>
<li>User name and password are now passed properly to the authenticating proxy
when downloading gems.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.9.1 / 2007-01-16</h3>
<p>
See ChangeLog
</p>
<h3>0.9.0 / 2006-06-28</h3>
<p>
Finally, the much anticipated RubyGems version 0.9.0 is now available. This
release includes a number of new features and bug fixes. The number one
change is that we can now download the gem index incrementally. This will
greatly speed up the gem command when only a few gems are out of date.
</p>
<p>
Major Enhancments include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The gem index is now downloaded incrementally, only updating entries that
are out of date. If more than 50 entries are out of date, we revert back to
a bulk download.

</li>
<li>Several patches related to allowing RubyGems to work with authenticating
proxies (from Danie Roux and Anatol Pomozov). Just put the user and
password in the proxy URL (e.g. -p <a
href="http://user:password@proxy.address.com:8080">user:password@proxy.address.com:8080</a>)
or use the HTTP_PROXY_USER and HTTP_PROXY_PASS environment variables.

</li>
<li>The gem unpack command can now accept a file path rather than just a
install gem name.

</li>
<li>Both RI and RDOC documents are now generated by default.

</li>
<li>A gemri command is included to read gem RI docs (only needed for Ruby 1.8.4
or earlier).

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Minor enhancements include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Verison 0.0.0 is now a valid gem version.

</li>
<li>Better detection of missing SSL functionality.

</li>
<li>SSL is not required if the security policy does not require signature
checking.

</li>
<li>Rake built extensions are now supported (Tilman Sauerbeck).

</li>
<li>Several autorequire bug fixes.

</li>
<li>&#8212;traceback is now an alias for &#8212;backtrace (I can never remember
which one it is).

</li>
<li>SAFE=1 compatibility fixes.

</li>
<li>.rbw is now a supported suffix for RubyGem&#8216;s custom require.

</li>
<li>Several Ruby 1.9 compatibility fixes (Eric Hodel).

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Bug Fixes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added dashes to gemspecs generated in Ruby 1.8.3. This solves some
cross-Ruby version compatibility issues.

</li>
<li>Fixed bug where the wrong executables could be uninstalled (Eric Hodel).

</li>
<li>Fixed bug where gem unpack occasionally unpacked the wrong gem.

</li>
<li>Fixed bug where a fatal error occured when permissions on .gemrc were too
restrictive (reported by Luca Pireddu).

</li>
<li>Fixed prefix handling for native expressions (patch by Aaron Patterson).

</li>
<li>Fixed several Upgrade =&gt; Update typos.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.8.11 / 2005-07-13</h3>
<ul>
<li>-y is a synonym for &#8212;include-dependencies.

</li>
<li>Better handling of errors in the top level rescue clause.

</li>
<li>Package list command (e.g. gem inspect GEM).

</li>
<li>.gemrc now allows cvsrc-like options to set defaults per subcommand.

</li>
<li>The autorequire gem spec field will now accept a list.

</li>
<li>Substituted Time for Date in specs, increasing performance dramatically.

</li>
<li>Fixed reported bug of gem directories ending in &quot;-&quot; (reported by
Erik Hatcher).

</li>
<li>Fixed but in installer that caused dependency installation to not work.

</li>
<li>Added Paul Duncan&#8216;s gem signing patch.

</li>
<li>Added Mark Hubbart&#8216;s Framework patch (for better integration with OS
X).

</li>
<li>Added David Glasser&#8216;s install-from-mirror patch.

</li>
<li>Additional internal structural cleanup and test reorganization.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.8.10 / 2005-03-27</h3>
<ul>
<li>In multi-user environments, it is common to supply mulitple versions of
gems (for example Rails), allowing individual users to select the version
of the gem they desire. This allows a user to be insulated from updates to
that gem. RubyGems 0.8.10 fixes a problem where gems could occasionally
become confused about the current versions of libraries selected by the
user.

</li>
<li>The other annoying bug is that if there are any existing rubygems-update
gems installed, then the &quot;gem update &#8212;system&quot; command will
download a new update, but install the latest update prior to the download.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.8.9</h3>
<p>
Never released
</p>
<h3>0.8.8 / 2005-03-14</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moved the master definition of class Requirement back under version. Kept
the body of Requirement under <a href="../classes/Gem.html">Gem</a>.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.8.7 / 2005-03-14</h3>
<p>
Even though it has only been a few weeks since that last release, there are
quite a number of new features in 0.8.7. A complete list of new features
will be given below, but here is a summary of the hot items.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The bug that prevented some users from installing rails has been squashed.
A big thanks to Bill Guindon (aGorilla) for helping track that one down.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are several new commands available on the gem command:
</p>
<ul>
<li>gem cleanup GEMNAME &#8212; Cleanup (uninstall) all the old versions of
gem. If the gem name is omitted, the entire repository is cleaned.

</li>
<li>gem dependency GEMNAME &#8212; Show the dependencies for the named gems.
This is really helpful when trying to figure out what gem needs what other
gem.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
There changes to the existing commands as well.
</p>
<ul>
<li>gem uninstall is much smarter about removing gems from the repository.
Lists of gems are now uninstalled in proper dependency order (ie. if A
depends on B, A is uninstalled first). Also, warnings about broken
dependencies occur only when removing the <b>last</b> gem that supports a
dependency is removed.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Both gem install and gem uninstall support some new command line options
that can reduce the amount of yes/no queries given the user. For install we
have:
</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8212;ignore-dependencies &#8212; Only install requests gems, no
dependendecies are automatically installed.

</li>
<li>&#8212;include-dependencies &#8212; Automatically install dependencies,
without confirmation.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
For gem uninstall, the new options are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8212;all &#8212; Uninstall all matching gems without confirmation.

</li>
<li>&#8212;ignore-dependencies &#8212; Uninstall, even if dependencies are
broken.

</li>
<li>&#8212;executables &#8212; Remove executables without confirmation

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Under general cleanup, gems will not, by default, run RDoc on packages that
do not have the RDoc flag set.
</p>
<p>
And finally there is a new library file &#8216;gemconfigure&#8217; to aid
in writing version sensitive applications (without undue dependencies on
RubyGems); and &#8216;gemwhich&#8217;, a short script to locate libraries
in the file system. You can read more about them here:
</p>
<ul>
<li>gemconfigure: <a
href="http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/4#page73">docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/4#page73</a>

</li>
<li>gemwhich: <a

</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.8.6 / 2005-02-27</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a small bug with shebang construction

</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.8.5 / 2005-02-26</h3>
<p>
Do you know how you used to dread getting the following message while
installing gems?
</p>
<pre>
  Updating Gem source index for: http://gems.rubyforge.org
</pre>
<p>
It could take up to 30 seconds (on my machine, even worse on others) for
that crazy source index to update.
</p>
<p>
This latest release of RubyGems speeds that wait time up considerably. The
following table gives the following times for installing RedCloth with a
required source index update on three system we had available to us. No
RDoc generation was included in the following times.
</p>
<pre>
  RubyGems    Linux         Mac OSX      Windows
  0.8.4       33 secs       73 secs      58 secs
  0.8.5        8 secs       14 secs      21 secs
</pre>
<p>
The new caching code is at least 3x faster than previous versions. Woo Hoo!
</p>
<h3>0.8.4 / 2005-01-01</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rubygems 0.8.3&#8216;s installer was broken unless you already had an older
version of RubyGems installed. That&#8216;s fixed.

</li>
<li>Change in the way <a
href="../classes/Gem/Specification.html">Gem::Specification</a> internally
deals with lazy attributes and defaults, bringing (with some
loadpath_manager changes) a fairly significant increase in speed.

</li>
<li>Support for lower-cased <a href="../classes/Gem.html">Gem</a> file names
(for you, Paul Duncan :)

</li>
<li>Erik Veenstra&#8216;s patch for making <a
href="../classes/Gem.html">Gem</a> versions sortable.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.8.3 / 2004-12-07</h3>
<p>
No real earth shattering news here, but there were a number of really
annoying issues involving other libraries that RubyGems depends upon. 0.8.3
contains some workarounds for these issues. In particular:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added workaround for the null byte in Dir string issue. (see <a
href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/121702">blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/121702</a>).
(Thanks to Mauricio FernÃ¡ndez for the quick response on this one).

</li>
<li>Added workaround for old version of Zlib on windows that caused Ruwiki to
fail to install. (see <a
href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/121770">blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/121770</a>)

</li>
<li>Added workaround for large YAML file issues. (We dynamically cut down the
size of the source index YAML file and seem to have worked around immediate
issues.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
There has been some minor usability enhancements and changes &#8230;
</p>
<ul>
<li>A user specific source index cache can be used when the site-wide cache is
unwritable (i.e. because you are running as a non-admin). This
<b>greatly</b> speeds up gem commands run in non-admin mode when the
site-wide cache is out of date.

</li>
<li>The gem command now used an HTTP HEAD command to detect if the
server&#8216;s source index needs to be downloaed.

</li>
<li>gem check gemname &#8212;test will run unit tests on installed gems that
have unit tests.

</li>
<li>Multiple gem names are allowed on the gem install command line. This means
you can do:

<pre>
  gem install rake rails needle postgres-pr pimki
</pre>
<p>
(Ok, you get the idea)
</p>
</li>
<li>Multiple authors my be specified in a <a href="../classes/Gem.html">Gem</a>
spec.

</li>
<li>Switched to using setup.rb (rather than a custom install script) for the
installation of RubyGems itself. If you have installed RubyGems before,
double check the installation instructions and make sure you use setup.rb
instead of install.rb.

</li>
<li>Ryan Davis has provided a patch so you can use an env variable (GEM_SKIP),
to tell loadpath_manager not to load gems of those names. This was useful
for him while testing libs that he had in development.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.8.1 / 2009-09-14</h3>
<ul>
<li>Quick release to capture some bug fixes.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.8.0 / 2009-09-12</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remove need for library stubs. Set the RUBYOPT environment variable to
include &quot;rrubygems&quot;, and a normal require will find gem files.
Continue to use &#8216;require_gem gem_name, version&#8217; to specify gem
versions.

</li>
<li>Deprecated &quot;test_suite_file&quot; gemspec attribute in favor of
&quot;test_files&quot; array.

</li>
<li>Generates rdoc by default on installs.

</li>
<li>Adopted tar/gzip file format, thanks to Mauricio Fernandez.

</li>
<li>&quot;gem rdoc&quot; allows generation of rdoc after gem installation (will
add a &quot;gem test&quot;

</li>
<li>Application stubs can now accept an optional parameter of <em>VERSION</em>
that will run an arbitrary version of the application requested.

</li>
<li>Various bug fixes

</li>
<li>Various platform-independency improvements

</li>
<li>&quot;gem spec &#8212;all&quot; displays spec info for all installed
version of a given gem.

</li>
<li>Dynamic caching of sources

</li>
<li>Support for user-definable sources on the command line (thanks Assaph Mehr)

</li>
<li>More intelligent support for platform-dependent gems. Use Platform::CURRENT
when building a gem to set its platform to the one you&#8216;re building
on. Installation displays a choice of platform-dependent gems, allowing the
user to pick.

</li>
<li>Added &quot;gem unpack&quot; for &quot;unpacking&quot; a gem to the current
directory

</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.7.0 / 2004-07-09</h3>
<p>
See ChangeLog
</p>
<h3>0.6.0 / 2004-06-08</h3>
<ul>
<li>Collapse output of &#8212;search and &#8212;list (and gem_server)
operations so that each gem is listed only once, with each of its versions
listed on the same line.

</li>
<li>bin/gem: new &#8212;upgrade-all option allows one to upgrade every
installed gem

</li>
<li>new required_ruby_version attribute added to gem specification for
specifying a dependency on which version of ruby the gem needs. Format it
accepts is the same as the <a
href="../classes/Gem/Requirement.html">Gem::Version::Requirement</a>
format:

<pre>
  spec.required_ruby_version = &quot;&gt; 1.8.0&quot;
</pre>
</li>
<li>&#8212;install-stub defaults to true, so library stubs are created

</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.5.0 / 2004-06-06</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jim added the ability to specify version constraints to avoid API
incompatibilities. This has been the subject of much debate for the past
couple of months, with many ideas and code contributed by Eivind Eklund and
Mauricio Fernandez. The following set of assertions shows how it works:

<pre>
  assert_inadequate(&quot;1.3&quot;, &quot;~&gt; 1.4&quot;)
  assert_adequate(  &quot;1.4&quot;, &quot;~&gt; 1.4&quot;)
  assert_adequate(  &quot;1.5&quot;, &quot;~&gt; 1.4&quot;)
  assert_inadequate(&quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;~&gt; 1.4&quot;) # This one is key--the new operator
                                     # disallows major version number
                                     # differences.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Group gem search output when multiple versions exist for a given gem:

<pre>
  activerecord (0.7.8, 0.7.7, 0.7.6, 0.7.5)
    Implements the ActiveRecord pattern for ORM.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Add arbitrary RDoc-able files via gemspec (not just Ruby source files) for
people who have, for example, README.rdoc in their distributions. Add to
gemspec via: spec.extra_rdoc_files = [&quot;list&quot;, &quot;of&quot;,
&quot;files&quot;]. Ruby files are automatically included.

</li>
<li>Some small bug fixes

</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.4.0 / 2004-05-31</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minor bug fixes including Windows compatability issues

</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.3.0 / 2004-04-30</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cleanup of command-line arguments and handling. Most commands accept a
&#8212;local or &#8212;remote modifier.

</li>
<li>Creation of Application Gems (packages that include executable programs).
See <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl?DeveloperGuide">rubygems.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl?DeveloperGuide</a>
for information on how to use it.

</li>
<li>Basic functionality for installing binary gems from source (:extensions
property of gem specification holds an array of paths to extconf.rb files
to be used for compilation)

</li>
<li>Install library &quot;stub&quot; allowing a normal &#8216;require&#8217; to
work (which then does the rubygems require and &#8216;require_gem&#8216;

</li>
<li>&#8212;run-tests runs the test suite specified by the
&quot;test_suite_file&quot; property of a gem specification

</li>
<li>HTTP Proxy support works. Rewrite of HTTP code.

</li>
<li>Unit and functional tests added (see Rakefile).

</li>
<li>Prompt before remote-installing dependencies during gem installation.

</li>
<li>Config file for storing preferences for &#8216;gem&#8217; command usage.

</li>
<li>Generally improved error messages (still more work to do)

</li>
<li>Rearranged gem directory structure for cleanliness.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.2.0 / 2004-03-14</h3>
