  body: ZipInputStream is the basic class for reading zip entries in a zip file. It is possible to create a ZipInputStream object directly, passing the zip file name to the constructor, but more often than not the ZipInputStream will be obtained from a ZipFile (perhaps using the ZipFileSystem interface) object for a particular entry in the zip archive.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: A ZipInputStream inherits IOExtras::AbstractInputStream in order to provide an IO-like interface for reading from a single zip entry. Beyond methods for mimicking an IO-object it contains the method get_next_entry for iterating through the entries of an archive. get_next_entry returns a ZipEntry object that describes the zip entry the ZipInputStream is currently reading from.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Example that creates a zip archive with ZipOutputStream and reads it back again with a ZipInputStream.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  require 'zip/zip'\n\n  Zip::ZipOutputStream::open(&quot;my.zip&quot;) {\n    |io|\n\n    io.put_next_entry(&quot;first_entry.txt&quot;)\n    io.write &quot;Hello world!&quot;\n\n    io.put_next_entry(&quot;adir/first_entry.txt&quot;)\n    io.write &quot;Hello again!&quot;\n  }\n\n  Zip::ZipInputStream::open(&quot;my.zip&quot;) {\n    |io|\n\n    while (entry = io.get_next_entry)\n      puts &quot;Contents of #{entry.name}: '#{io.read}'&quot;\n    end\n  }\n"

  body: java.util.zip.ZipInputStream is the original inspiration for this class.
